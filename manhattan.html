    <p>
        It was the first time you came over to my apartment, but it was my last night in New York. I was ending my relationship with the queer city of my dreams. I started crying while we were having sex. It wasn't about you, but I could tell you were hurt. You left before the sun came up and I walked to Bethesda fountain.
