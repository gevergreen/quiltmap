    <h1>The Steps by the Lake</h1>
    <p>
        After spending several years together, and soon after a slow and steady recovery from their top surgery, I proposed to my soon-to-be husband on these steps on a cool September night. They immediately said yes, and hugged me more deeply than ever before. I love being gay cat dads with them.</p>
