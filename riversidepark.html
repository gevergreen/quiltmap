        We had 2 dates over Zoom before meeting for our first date here. It was the middle of January and freezing cold. You brought a thermos full of hot toddy and paper cups. We walked around the park until we couldn't feel our hands anymore. We didn't kiss because of Covid but I really wanted to.
